        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          My topic throughout the semester has been the Fading American Dream.
          After investigating this topic I have taken a keen interest in
          generational wealth gaps by examining how the wealth between
          generations of people has diminished as older people have been
          increasing their wealth younger generations have seen a higher cost of
          living and fewer opportunities for wealth growth. I also have examined
          housing affordably, or more accurately lack thereof. Observing home
          prices and interest rates have skyrocketed in the past few years.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I dive into this final presentation it's important to know the
          theoretical perspective I have been using. That is Structural
          functionalism. Which is essentially applying fixes to the current way
          society is structured. The most valuable knowledge I gained from the
          journal articles was about the general wealth gaps so as we explore
          this topic for a final time, please remember that if we do not make
          strides to fix this situation it shall only worsen as the current
          generation grows and future generations come.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Considering the chapters we viewed in the past there are 2 main ones
          that stood out to me. Chapter One, which was our introduction chapter,
          and Chapter 4, Social Class Inequality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chapter 1: This may seem unconventail as an introduction chapter does
          provide the theoretical foundation and provides insight into how the
          course may progress, it does not have an obvious correlation to the
          Fading American Dream as other chapters might. That is actually my
          point though. When we were introduced to this subject, we embraced
          many different theoretical perspectives and the only thing they all
          had in common was they were over 150 years old, like the "modern" day
          education system. We have read journal articles on sociological topics
          but strangely we did not explore any modern-day sociological theories.
          That doesn't mean they don't exist but, the fact our course is even
          built on these older concepts plays into the fading American dream as
          new ideas and theories are swept under the rug in favor of outdated
          and tested systems that clearly fail for one reason or another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chapter 4: Social class inequality had us explore the concept that
          wealth controls the advantages an individual may have in life. We saw
          that people who have money dominate the us economy but those people
          make up a very small population percentage and considering America
          makes up 27% of the global GDP it shows the depth of the power the
          ultra-wealthy have. We explored that outside a lavish lifestyle, those
          born into higher-income families tend to receive higher quality
          education \, grow up in safer and cleaner neighborhoods, and have an
          advantage in career opportunities. This plays into the fading American
          dream as the separation between social class and generational wealth
          indicates that as time continues to pass, the quality of education
          will decrease, and those who are wealthy will cut out more from those
          who don't.

        <p>
          There are two solutions that I foresee. Let's first take a look at the
          boring... I mean, a reasonable one is.
        </p>
        <p>
          People tend to be unaware of how much they have as constituents of
          assembly members and congressmen/congresswomen. You can complain about
          any issue and submit an opinion let me show you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Step One Go to:
          <a href="https://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/">Find your Rep</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Step two: State your name, and submit an opinion. Be nice please to
          the representative. Unless they are rude, then do as you please.
