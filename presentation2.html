              Today we will dive further into the fading American Dream by
              discussing, inflation and generational wealth gaps and how they
              affect the cost of living and diminish the American Dream
              obtainability.

            <p class="fade-in">
              The data gathered in this article was via a large survey of adults and elderly American households. Looking at this data, we can actually view a lot of useful information. Of the households that had a child from 1989-2013, the household net worth has decreased by 64.9%, whereas for elderly households, net worth has increased by 40.6%. Additionally, households with children seem to be more educated and more likely to have a spouse who should help with taxes and job opportunities. Despite that, elderly households are worth more.

            <p class="fade-in">
              This graph takes a deeper look at the net worth between elderly and child households while looking at everyone else. It's evident that elder households have substantially more wealth than any other group in America. All groups took a hit during the recession aside from that though the gap had been increasing over time and since the recession, the climb back up has continued.

            <h2 class="fade-in">Unemployment and inflation</h2>
            <p class="fade-in">
              After the COVID-19 pandemic hit we saw a massive increase in inflation however we also saw a massive increase in unemployment. The graph you see shows you the job opening rate and unemployment rate during and after the pandemic we witnessed many layoffs and people quitting their jobs. Interestingly it hadn't been since 1955 when inflation exceeded 4% and unemployment over 5%. Yes in 2019 in a single quarter, inflation was up over 7% while unemployment was over 10%. This leads to signs of an overheating economy and usually means a large recession is to come.

            <p class="fade-in">
              As predicted the market did crash a little bit however it also made a comeback. The S&P500 raised in value dramatically then dropped significantly this was partly due to the overheating economy but, there is more information to consider. such as Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street owning 89% of the S&P500. The decline in these index funds affects people's retirement accounts and helped justify corporations' price hikes however it was evident that their profits were already well above taking any major hits.

                It's intresting to view wealth disparties with inflation hikes. Looking at this from a human perspective I think it's intersting that many of our elected officals to run the goverment are in the same generation that has the majority of the wealth.

            <p class="fade-in">
                Too connect this to my first presentaion on housing unaffordabilty connecting the the fading American dream as a whole. increased inflation affected the housing market and the higher intrest rates only made cost of living higher and homeownersip more difficult. High unemployment in combination with this raised cost of lving and home prices dramically increased leads to a very unfourtante situation for modren day americans making the American dream seem reallly like a dream not a potentail obtainabilty.
