                    <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
                    <p>Avlory is devoted to changing the world. I am not incompetent enough to reveal our master plan to a group of people I do not know, but people need to be aware of what's coming. There are two things required to change a system. One: people must want the change. Two: The current system must be mastered, because of this, it's common that greed and lust corrupt individuals in power, and therefore no change occurs. If there is any change it's to their benefit first. </p>
        <p>With that in mind I am releasing paperwork to my closest friends that will allow them to remove me from power should I become corrupt and let them execute the plan. This may appear that I want to take over the world. Truly, I would rather untie the human race under one flag that way we can focus on improving our planet, ourselves, and the quality of life and discovery. With that in mind, I don't want to control you all that's too big of a pain. I think the world needs to be open to several ideas but accept differences. Narrow-minded people block progress. It's fine to have different opinions but, you must be willing to accept that you may be in the wrong. My goal is to reform the world. Such a revolution is a massive undertaking. I promise you though I am well prepared for that.</p>
        <p>There are many issues with the planet, but here are a few reforms I would install. Remember, you can create the change you desire,  just be civil and analyze your situation, adapt, evolve, and then conquer.</p>
