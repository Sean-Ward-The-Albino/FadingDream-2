                <h2>What is the Fading American Dream</h2>
                <p>The fading american dream is looking at the downfall of what America is suppose to represent. We
                    called the "Land of opportunity" and despite that title the opportunities we actually have seem o
                    diminish daily.</p>
                <p>The United States of America is a global superpower and countries are constantly observing us to see
                    how the world will be shaped this is import to everyone's livelihood as governments are supposed to
                    protect us and have order as social contract theory dictates</p>

                <h2>Focusing on Housing</h2>
                <p>Part of the American Dream is housing and being able own property. The housing market has skyrocketed
                    in pricing and
                    while interest rates have gone up wages have remained stagnant there are solutions to this problem
                    though.</p>
                <p>In American we Have the Housing and Urban Development department also known as HUd They are:</p>
                <p>"The principal federal agency responsible for programs concerned with housing needs, fair housing
                    opportunities, and
                    improving and developing U.S. communities."</p>
                <p> you can find more imformation about HUD <a

                    <h2>Observing the problem</h2>
                    <p>We have an agency dedicated to creating housing opportunities however the issue seems to be that
                        they do not
                        actually regulate the source of those opportunities</p>
                    <p>In america the cost of housing has always gone up however The median price of homes dramatically
                        increased from
                        $313,000 to <strong>$475,000</strong> in Q4 of 2022.</p>
                    <p>you can see the data for the market <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS">here</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>To understand how we can fix the problem we must obverse where it started. The prices started to
                        alter in 2020.</p>
                    <p>In 2020 there was the covid-19 Pandemic which caused a mass layoff percentage around the country.
                        SO if unemployment
                        has gone up how did the the pricing of houses increase by so much.</p>
                    <p>Investors and corporations would the responsible party for this. As Companies such as Blackrock
                        and Vanguard starting
                        buying houses and covering their tracks through media manipulation the got into bidding wars
                        with average families
                        to acquire homes.</p>
                    <p>The real estate tax code allows for income that comes from homes is so generous to landlords that
                        many
                        multi-millionaire investors took the opportunity of lower interest meant for middle class
                        families to purchase homes
                        to rent out for increased</p>

                <h2>Applying Structural Functionalism </h2>
                <p>This approach would try to fix the problem while keeping capitalism in tact</p>
                <p>Here's a list of possible solutions that we could apply to help fix the issue:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not allow corporations or LLCs to purchase homes. This would stop corporations from sweeping the
                        housing market</li>
                    <li>Update real estate tax code. disincentive multi-millionaires from obtaining new more than a
                        certain number of homes.</li>
                    <li>regulate housing costs. Create a limit on how much houses can cost per sqft and add in variables
                        to make costs fair but affordable.</li>
                    <li>Increase wages so that people can actually acquire downpayments to get their own homes.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>As I go deeper in learning sociology I want to learn about how jobs and wages affect the fading American
                dream.</p>
